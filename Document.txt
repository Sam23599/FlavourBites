Objective: Develop a Mobile Application for Restaurant Services

Introduction:
The project aims to create a user-friendly mobile application providing restaurant services, including user location tracking, an intuitive home page, a comprehensive restaurant/hotel page showcasing available dishes, and an efficient "Add to Cart" feature.

Approach:

Dependency Setup:

The initial phase involved setting up all necessary dependencies to ensure a smooth development process. This included configuring the development environment and installing required libraries and frameworks.
User Location Integration:

The first major task was to implement user location functionality. By utilizing relevant APIs and services, the application now accurately tracks the user's location, providing a personalized experience.
Homepage Development:

Following location integration, emphasis was placed on creating an engaging and user-friendly home page. This section serves as the central hub, offering quick access to various features and information.
Restaurant/Hotel Page:

The subsequent phase focused on designing and implementing the restaurant/hotel page. This component presents a detailed view of available dishes offered by each establishment. It incorporates aesthetically pleasing visuals and pertinent information to enhance user engagement.
Add to Cart Feature:

The final component addressed the crucial "Add to Cart" feature. Users can effortlessly select desired items from the restaurant/hotel page and add them to their cart for a streamlined ordering process.
Next Steps:
Moving forward, the development roadmap includes rigorous testing, user feedback incorporation, and the addition of supplementary features to further enhance the application's functionality.

Conclusion:
This approach prioritizes a systematic and iterative development process, ensuring each component is meticulously crafted to meet both functional and aesthetic requirements. Regular testing and user feedback will be integral to refining the application and delivering a seamless experience to end-users.
