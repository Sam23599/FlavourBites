setup Android SDK as followed in the article-

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native&os=linux#target-os-1


setup environment-variables properly, specially in ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc and /etc/environment
something like this (ur ANDROID_HOME path should exactly be the place where you installed the Android SDK)- 

export ANDROID_HOME=/media/sam/media/Android/SDK
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
